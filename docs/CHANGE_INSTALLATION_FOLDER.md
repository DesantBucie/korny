There are two ways, pick one:

## 1. 
    * Follow normal installation.

    * Then Just copy `~/.local/share/korny` to the desired place and edit $KORNY\_FOLDER in .kshrc 

## 2.
    First clone this git repository.

    * Change TARGET_FOLDER to preffered location in bin/install.ksh.

    * Change KORNY_FOLDER in .kshrc to path/from/target/foder/korny.

    * Run install.ksh and remove originally cloned repo.
